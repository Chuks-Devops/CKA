# Kubernetes Requests & Limits 

## What's the Deal with Requests & Limits?
Think of your Kubernetes cluster as a bustling city and pods as tenants in an apartment building. Each tenant (pod) requires specific resources like CPU and memory to function:

- Requests: This is the minimum amount of resources a pod needs to operate smoothly. Think of it as a guaranteed reservation for the pod.
- Limits: This is the maximum amount of resources a pod can use. It acts as a safety cap to prevent any pod from consuming more than its fair share and disrupting others.

Why are Requests & Limits Important?

- Resource Control: By setting limits, you prevent a single pod from monopolizing resources, which can lead to issues like out-of-memory (OOM) kills or CPU starvation. ☠️ Why OOM can be a good thing? Because it kills the pod; otherwise, the container would have consumed all the memory and could kill the node. Killing the pod is a better option than killing a node itself.
- Predictability: Requests help the scheduler allocate resources efficiently and ensure pods have the necessary resources to run effectively.

### To see the CPU and Memory utilization of the nodes
```
kubectl apply -f metrcs-server.yaml
kubectl top node
```

### To test your cluster
```
kubectl create ns mem-example
```

### To check the cpu and memory of a pod
```
kubectl top pod pod-name -n namespace
```
